**Interests:** Footy :soccer:, trading, building start-ups and models. Likely in that order. Macro modelling, regime-switching, distributed systems, and learning. Also like to ski and cook.

**Building/Writing:** 
- "Classifying with Unbalanced Costs" with VVB

- What is the predictive value of yield curve convergence?
- What is the best way to model the flight-to-quality phenomenon?
- How do we dampen drawdowns specific to momentum portfolios (the rest of the market does not notice)?
- How doe we track "excellent leadership" in the market?
- Why isn't there a better way to share articles and papers?
- Why isn't there a social version of Kalshi for betting with published prediction records?
