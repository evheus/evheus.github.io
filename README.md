**Interests:** Footy, trading, building start-ups and models. Likely in that order. Macro modelling, regime-switching, distributed systems, and learning. Also like to ski and to cook.

**Building:** 
1) Bull/Bear market indicator. Using unemployment, inflation, equity valuations, ISM, private sector balances, and yield curves.
2) Bear market rally long puts system. Using volume, momentum, and volatility.

**Interesting questions:**
- What happens when yield curves converge?
- What is the best way to model the flight-to-quality phenomenon?
- How do we dampen drawdowns specific to momentum portfolios (the rest of the market does not notice)?
- How do we find evidence that security X leads security Y?
- Why isn't there a better way to share articles and papers?

** Past Projects and Papers:**
- Paired (dormant), see pitch deck here.
- "Classifying with Unbalanced Costs" with VVB
- Arbitrage bot to front run copy traders of high profile public traders in small crypto markets
- Energy drink flavor sentiment analysis/prediction
